where , hadoopHome  is set to HADOOP_HOME installation directory of the version against which this needs to be compiled against.

Usage / Goals:
=============

Warning: the project is in its pre-infancy serving a very limited purpose at the moment of packing files. 
More use cases are planned down the pipeline.

* pack:
------

Currently a single goal is available called as 'pack' that creates the jar file to be submitted to the hadoop job engine. 

The jar contains a directory called ./lib , that contains all the dependent jars in the same. 
The classes of the current project are also available in the same. 

The jar would be created in $basedir/target/hadoop-deploy/${ant.project.name}-hdeploy.jar  . 

$ mvn hadoop:pack

Once created , this could be submitted to the hadoop jar engine 

$ $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar  $basedir/target/hadoop-deploy/${ant.project.name}-hdeploy.jar   job.launching.class

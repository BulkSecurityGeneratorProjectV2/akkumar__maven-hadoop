Currently a single goal is available called as pack that creates the jar file to be submitted to the hadoop job engine. 

The jar contains a directory called ./lib , that contains all the dependent jars in the same. 
The classes of the current project are also available in the same. 

The jar would be created in $basedir/target/hadoop-deploy/${ant.project.name}-hdeploy.jar  .

Once created , this could be submitted to the hadoop jar engine 

$ $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar  $basedir/target/hadoop-deploy/${ant.project.name}-hdeploy.jar   toolrunner.implementing.myclassname
